# Title: PacMen

# Description:
This is a simple project that displays my JavaScript, CSS, and DOM manipulation abilities.
The user can create an infinite amount of pacmen using the "create pacman" button and upon
clicking start, the pacmen will bounce around the screen.

# How to run:
1. Clone repo onto to your local machine
2. Locate repo in your finder
3. Drag and drop the index.html file into a browser window

# Roadmap:
One potential future improvement will be increased animation. For example, the pacmen will be
opening and closing their mouths as they move across the screen, as opposed to a static image.
